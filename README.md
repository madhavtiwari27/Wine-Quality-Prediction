_**Project Title:**_

Wine Quality Predition



_**Description:**_

The main objective of this project is the quality determination of a wine sample via wine certification.

Wine certification includes physiochemical tests like determination of density, pH, alcohol quantity, 
fixed and volatile acidity.

The quality of the sample is portrayed on a 
scale of 1-10. 

This project uses a large dataset having physiochemical test results of 
wines of the Vinho Verde variety.

Such a model can be used not only by 
the certification bodies but also by the wine producers to improve quality 
based on the physicochemical properties and by the consumers to predict 
the quality of wines.



_**Approach/Algorithms:**_

For this project we have implemented the use of: 

1)Random Forest Algorithm 

2)Confusion Matrix 

3)Pandas 

4)Tkinter 

5)NumPy 

6)Matploitlib 

7)Seaborn

8)Scikit-Learn


_**Test Procedures:**_

User inputs data for various fields representing following 
physiochemical properties: 

Fixed Acidity, Volatile Acidity, Citric Acid, Residual Sugar, Chlorides, 
Sulfur Dioxide, Density, pH, Sulphates and ABV(alcohol by volume). 


**_Update:_**

The project has been instantiated for bot red and white wine.


_**Results:**_

The program gives a rating as per the input on a scale of 1-10 regarding 
the quality of the wine.
